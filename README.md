# FUNDAMENTALS-OF-CAD



Computer-Aided Design (CAD) refers to the use of computer software and systems to create, modify, analyze, and optimize designs. Here are some fundamental concepts of CAD:

Geometric Modeling: CAD systems use geometric modeling to represent objects and shapes digitally. This includes 2D geometry for drawings and 3D geometry for solid modeling.

# 2D Drafting:
In 2D drafting, CAD software is used to create technical drawings, plans, and diagrams. This involves using tools like lines, circles, arcs, text, dimensions, and layers to represent objects in two dimensions.

# 3D Modeling:
3D modeling allows designers to create and manipulate three-dimensional objects. Common techniques include extrusion, lofting, sweeping, and Boolean operations (union, difference, intersection).
